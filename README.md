# Security-Camera
A security camera(client) that sits in the corner of my room and sends video files over the network to my desktop assistant which is powered by another raspberry pi(the server). A new file is created every hour to make it easier to search for a specific point in time. Note that a good heatsink and/or fan is necessary to send continuous recordings at good quality and frame rates.

After a couple of hours the videos start losing frames which makes the video files look sped up. I do not know if this is because I need a heatsink and fan on both raspberry pi boards because I only have one on my desktop assistant. If anyone could solve this issue it would be greatly appreciated.
